NAME
    Uttu::Changes - Change Log

DESCRIPTION
    This document lists the changes to Uttu introduced with each release.
    This list should not be considered exhaustive. Major bug fixes and API
    changes should be here.

VERSION 0.05
  New Features

    Uttu->query_dbh_database
        This method will return the database being used, given the same
        arguments as "query_dbh".

    $u -> query_host_available
    $u -> set_host_available
    $u -> set_host_unavailable
        These can be used to track available hosts. The database support in
        Uttu can use this to avoid connection attempts to machines known to
        be unavailable.

    $u -> resource
        This method will return the ResourcePool object for a given
        resource. The resource pools are configured via the
        "global_resources" configuration file option.

        Resources can be shared across sites.

        Eventually, Uttu may use this to manage DBI connections (in which
        case the above host-availability functions will be deprecated).

    Error Messages
        Added more thorough error reporting when there is a server error.

  Bug Fixes

    memory leak
        Requesting the cache object created a new cache object each time. We
        now cache the cache objects across requests.

    AxKit invocation
        Previous versions of Uttu used code copied from AxKit. We now call
        the AxKit handler directly and use the proper API for managing the
        AxKit configuration. Uttu should be able to withstand AxKit upgrades
        more easily.

VERSION 0.04
  New Features

    Apache::Template
        Apache::Template is now required to use the template content
        handler.

    AxKit Document Roots
        Added support for multiple document roots similar to that in
        HTML::Mason and Template Toolkit.

    Tests
        Added tests. These require Apache::Test, DBI, and DBD::CSV since the
        tests need to be run in a web server and the database connection
        code can't be tested without a database to connect to (in this case,
        CSV files).

VERSION 0.03
  New Features

    AxKit
        Added support for AxKit as a content handler (see the
        Uttu::Handler::axkit manpage). AxKit allows using any of the other
        content handlers as XML sources.

  Bug Fixes

    Uttu is more robust
        Put in several checks for certain conditions that could cause an
        error. We try to avoid them now.

  Modified Behavior

    Database Connections
        We now use multiple host specifications instead of multiple database
        specifications to allow failover.

    Secondary Content Provision
        The Template and Mason handlers have been modified to work as XML
        sources for AxKit.

VERSION 0.02
  New Features

    DBIx::Abstract
        Instead of using DBI directly, we now use DBIx::Abstract. Allows us
        more configurability. As a result, code can be specified in the
        configuration that produces a WHERE clause for use in mapping uris
        to filenames (and filenames to uris). If a WHERE statement is
        created, it is used as part of the key for cacheing.

    Apache Configuration Directives
        Added "UttuDefine", "UttuDefineList", "UttuDefineMap" to allow
        partial configuration in the Apache configuration files. Allowed
        "UttuConf" to accept multiple file names.

    mod_perl 2.0
        Added detection of mod_perl 2.0 (or 1.99 for beta 2.0 releases). For
        now, Uttu will issue a warning, but this will be used in the future
        for mod_perl 2.0 compatability.

    Command line use
        Uttu should be usable from a command-line program (Apache not
        required). This is handy for using the session, authentication, or
        authorization code in a framework. Allows the command-line program
        to use the same Uttu configuration file as the Apache server.

    [global] configuration variables
        Added "db_uri_map_table", "db_uri_map_field_file",
        "db_uri_map_field_uri", "db_uri_map_where", "hostname", "index",
        "port", "translate_uri".

        Removed "db_uri_map_select_comp", "db_uri_map_select_uri",
        "fallback_language".

    Uttu methods
        Added "comp_to_rel_uri".

    Framework methods
        Added "init_config".

    Support for Template Toolkit
        Initial support added for using TT2 templates instead of HTML::Mason
        components (see the Uttu::Handler::template manpage).

    MakeMaker support for function sets
        Uttu::MakeMaker should be able to build and install function sets in
        addition to frameworks.

  Bug Fixes

    Uttu::MakeMaker support for function sets
        Uttu::MakeMaker should be able to install function sets.

        Uttu::MakeMaker does not yet support installation of uri-to-filename
        mappings.

VERSION 0.01
    Released 20 Mar 2002.

    This is the initial release of Uttu.
