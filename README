                            Uttu 0.04
                            ---------

Uttu is a web interface driver that works with a framework and 
function sets to build an application.  Support is provided for 
building the infrastructure for a site -- no demands are made for 
doing sessions in a particular way, or authenticating against a 
particular database. The actual specifics are defined by the 
framework. This allows you to create your own flavor of Uttu, if you 
desire, without having to muck around in the Uttu module. Think of LPC 
and LPMuds with their driver and mudlib.

To install Uttu, download the distribution, untar, and cd into the
resulting directory.  There, run the following:

  % perl Makefile.PL [UTTU_PREFIX=...]
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

If the Apache::Test framework is installed, the tests will be run 
against an Apache server.  Otherwise, any tests requiring a working 
Apache server will be skipped.  Any tests requiring uri mappings will 
be skipped if DBD::CSV is not installed.

The UTTU_PREFIX optional parameter for Makefile.PL configures the default
installation prefix for frameworks and function sets.  Uttu provides an
easy way to install these parts of an application.  The default
installation prefix will be something similar to /usr/local/uttu (depends
on the Perl configuration).

The following modules are required to use the particular handler.  They 
are not part of the requirements list in the Makefile (and thus CPAN 
will not try to install them).

  axkit     Axkit
  mason     HTML::Mason
  template  Apache::Template
