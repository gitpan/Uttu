                            Uttu 0.02
                            ---------

Uttu is a web interface driver that works with a framework and function
sets to build an application.  Support is provided for building the
infrastructure for a site -- no demands are made for doing sessions in a
particular way, or authenticating against a particular database. The actual
specifics are defined by the framework. This allows you to create your own
flavor of Uttu, if you desire, without having to muck around in the Uttu
module. Think of LPC and LPMuds with their driver and mudlib.

To install Uttu, download the distribution, untar, and cd into the
resulting directory.  There, run the following:

  % perl Makefile.PL [UTTU_PREFIX=...]
  % make
  % make install

No non-trivial tests are provided at the moment.  Eventually, the
Apache::Test framework will be used to test the module.

The UTTU_PREFIX optional parameter for Makefile.PL configures the default
installation prefix for frameworks and function sets.  Uttu provides an
easy way to install these parts of an application.  The default
installation prefix will be something similar to /usr/local/uttu (depends
on the Perl configuration).

The author lurks on both the HTML::Mason list and the mod_perl list.  Feel
free to send questions there.
