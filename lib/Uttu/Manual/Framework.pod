=head1 NAME

Uttu::Manual::Framework - Description of frameworks.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Uttu by itself is insufficient for any reasonably complex site.  It
does not provide authentication, session management, or page layout.

A framework defines how all the infrastructure -- authentication and
session handling, for example -- works together.  It provides a code
context in which function sets (collections of pages,
configuration modules, etc.) run.

When installing a site using Uttu, you will need all the prerequisites of
Uttu, primarily Apache, mod_perl, a content handler such as HTML::Mason,
and AppConfig, as well as a framework.  The framework will determine which
function sets are available (or the function sets you want to use will
determine which framework you need).

A framework is a collection of Perl modules, content pages, and other files
which together provide a coherent environment in which to develop an
application, usually as a function set (or collection of them for fairly
complex applications).

Basically, this module handles everything up to the point the request is
handed over to the content handler.  The framework provides any
functionality after that point.

A framework should not itself provide any functionality that could be
viewed as part of an application.  It should limit itself to such general
tasks as session management, authentication, and authorization.

=head1 WRITING A FRAMEWORK

A framework consists of a Perl module which Uttu uses to configure the
framework, a collection of function sets that provide basic services such
as session management or authentication, and miscellanous files, such as a
root C<autohandler> for HTML::Mason.

=head2 Directory Layout

The installed and distribution directory layouts are different.  Which one
you use for development is up to you, but it can be easier to work in the
distribution layout and use symbolic links to map files to an installation
directory for testing.

A typical mapping of distribution to installation directories:

 l10n -> $uttu_prefix/framework/$framework/lib/Uttu/Framework/L10N/
 sets -> $uttu_prefix/framework/$framework/sets/
 lib  -> $uttu_prefix/framework/$framework/lib/
 support -> $uttu_prefix/framework/$framework/

In addition to these directories, there are also the C<conf> and C<t>
directories for particular configuration files and tests, respectively.

=head2 Example Framework

As an example, we will create the Simple framework.

 % cd ~/cvs
 % mkdir uttu-framework-simple
 % cd uttu-framework-simple
 % mkdir l10n support sets conf

In this directory, create the file Simple.pm with the following contents.

 package Uttu::Framework::Simple;
  
 use Uttu::Framework;
  
 use vars qw(@ISA $VERSION);
  
 @ISA = qw(Uttu::Framework);
  
 $VERSION = '0.01';
  
 1;

This establishes the basic framework with default behaviors.

TODO: describe how everything works

Last, we will create the file Makefile.PL, which is used to install the
framework.

 package Uttu::Framework::Simple;
  
 use Uttu::MakeMaker;
  
 WriteMakefile(
   NAME         => __PACKAGE__,
   VERSION_FROM => 'Simple.pm',
   AUTHOR       => 'James Smith <jgsmith@cpan.org>',
   ABSTRACT_FROM => 'Simple.pm',
   PREREQ_PM    => {
                   Uttu => 0.01,
                   },
 );

When run, this will create a Makefile that will put everything in the right
place.
