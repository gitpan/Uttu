Uttu::Changes - Change Log

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document lists the changes to Uttu introduced with each release.  This
list should not be considered exhaustive.  Major bug fixes and API changes
should be here.

=head1 VERSION 0.03

=head2 New Features

=over 4

=item AxKit

Added support for AxKit as a content handler (see L<Uttu::Handler::axkit>).  
AxKit allows using any of the other content handlers as XML sources.

=head2 Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item Uttu is more robust

Put in several checks for certain conditions that could cause an 
error.  We try to avoid them now.

=back 4

=head2 Modified Behavior

=over 4

=item Database Connections

We now use multiple host specifications instead of multiple 
database specifications to allow failover.

=item Secondary Content Provision

The Template and Mason handlers have been modified to work as XML 
sources for AxKit.

=back 4

=head1 VERSION 0.02

=head2 New Features

=over 4

=item DBIx::Abstract

Instead of using DBI directly, we now use DBIx::Abstract.  Allows us more
configurability.  As a result, code can be specified in the configuration
that produces a WHERE clause for use in mapping uris to filenames (and
filenames to uris).  If a WHERE statement is created, it is used as part of
the key for cacheing.

=item Apache Configuration Directives

Added C<UttuDefine>, C<UttuDefineList>, C<UttuDefineMap> to allow partial
configuration in the Apache configuration files.  Allowed C<UttuConf> to
accept multiple file names.

=item mod_perl 2.0 

Added detection of mod_perl 2.0 (or 1.99 for beta 2.0 releases).  For now,
Uttu will issue a warning, but this will be used in the future for mod_perl
2.0 compatability.

=item Command line use

Uttu should be usable from a command-line program (Apache not required).
This is handy for using the session, authentication, or authorization code
in a framework.  Allows the command-line program to use the same Uttu
configuration file as the Apache server.

=item [global] configuration variables

Added 
C<db_uri_map_table>,
C<db_uri_map_field_file>,
C<db_uri_map_field_uri>,
C<db_uri_map_where>,
C<hostname>,
C<index>,
C<port>,
C<translate_uri>.

Removed
C<db_uri_map_select_comp>,
C<db_uri_map_select_uri>,
C<fallback_language>.

=item Uttu methods

Added C<comp_to_rel_uri>.

=item Framework methods

Added C<init_config>.

=item Support for Template Toolkit

Initial support added for using TT2 templates instead of HTML::Mason
components (see L<Uttu::Handler::template>).

=item MakeMaker support for function sets

Uttu::MakeMaker should be able to build and install function sets in
addition to frameworks.

=back

=head2 Bug Fixes

=over 4

Uttu::MakeMaker does not yet support installation of uri-to-filename mappings.

=back
